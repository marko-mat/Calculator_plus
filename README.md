# Java Calculator  

A fully functional GUI-based calculator built using Java AWT. This project includes essential arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and a history feature for tracking calculations.  

## Features  

- Standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus  
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine  
- Power and square root calculations  
- Toggle for positive/negative values  
- Backspace and clear functions  
- History tracking for recent calculations  
- Expandable function panel for additional operations  

## Technologies Used  

- Java  
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository:
